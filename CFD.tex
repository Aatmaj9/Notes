\chapter{Basic aspects of discretization}
\section{Introduction}

Discretization is the process by which a closed-form mathematical expression such as a function 
or a differential or integral equation involving functions all of which are viewed as having 
finite continuum of values throughout some domain is approximated by analogous but different expressions which prescribe
values at only a finite number od discrete points or volumes.
